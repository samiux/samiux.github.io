Scam, phishing, malicious sites/ads/DNS, malware, ransomware, intrusion, ads everywhere nowadays.  For a better internet, we need to keep the interent fast, secure and clean!

To keep internet fast, secure and clean for every businesses and homes as well as mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, we need to deploy open source software - Suricata and Pi-Hole as well as OpenVPN.  

Suricata can configure to be an IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) and Pi-Hole can configure to block ads, malicious/tracking/bad links/sites/domains/DNS, malware and also cache the DNS traffic for faster browsing speed.  They can be installed to not only x86 hardware but also any ARM hardware or IoT devices.

By using OpenVPN with Suricata and Pi-Hole, you can add secure, fast, clean features to any mobile devices, such as smartphone or tablets.
