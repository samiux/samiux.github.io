|[Home](/README.md)|[Projects](/projects.md)|[Articles](/articles.md)|[Apophthegm](/apophthegm.md)|[About](/about.md)|

A cybersecurity enthusiast at heart, Samiux has been an OSCE, OSCP, and OSWP certified professional since 2012. While he runs his personal website and is an active blogger, Samiux also engages in building and breaking things, for a deeper understanding of cybersecurity. In his spare time, he can be found programming and reading, all the while enjoying his time in his penetration testing lab. Despite his vast experience in the field, Samiux modestly claims to know nothing about cybersecurity, always eager to learn more and continuously improve his skills.  Recently, he targets on health study.

His slogan are :

```
While you do not know attack, how can you know about defence? (未知攻,焉知防?)

Think like a criminal and act as professional

Not only try harder but also try smarter!

当认为是最安全的时候，就是最危险的时候。

治未病 我健康 我担当 (Prevent First, Own My Health)
```
