## Introduction

### What is DeepSeek R1?

DeepSeek-R1 is an AI model developed by Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Released in 20th January 2025, R1 holds its own against (and in some cases surpasses) the reasoning capabilities of some of the world’s most advanced foundation models — but at a fraction of the operating cost, according to the company. R1 is also open sourced under an MIT license, allowing free commercial and academic use.

There are three key ideas behind DeepSeek R1:

- Chain of Thought — Making the model explain itself.
- Reinforcement Learning — Letting it train itself.
- Distillation — Shrinking it without losing power.

### What is DOMPROS?

DOMPROS is an AI-Powered Penetration Testing Assistant that fully generated by DeepSeek R1.  It assist penetration testers to perform penetration tests.  It provides ```Search Exploit```, ```Analyze Findings```, ```Brainstrom``` and ```Tools suggestion``` to the penetration testers during their works.

You can use any LLM (Large Language Model) in the market while it is running on Ollama.  We recommended using DeepSeek R1 Distilled LLM as it can run on any low-end computer with or without GPUs.  The RAM is required at least 8GB.
