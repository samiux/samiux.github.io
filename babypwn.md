The ```libc-2.31.so``` may not be required and can be downloaded at [here](https://github.com/samiux/CTF/raw/main/pwn/babypwn/libc-2.31.so).  The ```flag.txt``` can be found [here](https://github.com/samiux/CTF/raw/main/pwn/babypwn/flag.txt).  As far as I know, ```libc-2.32.so``` also works properly.  

In general, you can run this binary on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Kernel 5.11.x) and/or Kali Linux (Kernel 5.14.x) without any problem.
